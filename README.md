# Algorithm Learning

### [Introduction to Algorithms (4th Edition)](https://amzn.to/3S4FlN2)
This is the most common and best textbook anyone could use to learn algorithms. It‚Äôs also the textbook my university used personally to learn the core and essential algorithms to most coding problems.

The 4th edition was recently released and is still relevant to MIT students. If you need structure and a traditional classroom setting to study, follow MIT‚Äôs algorithm course here.

### [William Fiset ‚Äî Graph Theory](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DgXR2OWQnLc&list=PLDV1Zeh2NRsDGO4--qE8yH72HFL1Km93P)
Graph theory does come up in interviews (and was a question I had at both Bloomberg and Google). Stay prepared and follow William Fiset‚Äôs graph theory explanation.

The diagrams are comprehensive and the step-by-step explanations are the best I‚Äôve ever seen on the topic.

### [CSES.fi Handbook](https://cses.fi/book/book.pdf)
This handbook is for people who are strongly proficient with most Leetcode algorithms. It‚Äôs a free resource that strongly complements the CSES.fi curriculum.

### [Competitive Programming 4th Ed.](https://amzn.to/3s3eOVx)
For the most experienced algorithm enthusiasts, this book will cover every niche data structure and algorithm that could possibly be asked in any coding interview. This level of preparation is not generally needed for FAANG type companies but can show up if you‚Äôre considering hedge fund type companies.

## Interviewing Resources

### [Cracking the Coding Interview (CTCI)](https://amzn.to/45AH7sf)
This is the simplest book to get anyone started in studying for coding interviews.

If you‚Äôre an absolute beginner, I recommend you to start here. The questions have very details explanations that are easy to understand with basic knowledge of algorithms and data structures.

### [Elements of Programming Interviews](https://amzn.to/46XaGoS)
If you‚Äôre a little more experienced, every question in this book is at the interviewing level of all large technology companies.

If you‚Äôve mastered the questions in this book, then you are more than ready for the average technology interview. The book is not as beginner friendly as CTCI but it does include a study plan depending on how much you need to prepare for your interviews. This is my personal favorite book I carried everywhere in university.

### [NeetCode blind 75](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLlXCFG5TnA&list=PLot-Xpze53ldVwtstag2TL4HQhAnC8ATf)
Blind has a list of 75 questions that is generally enough to solve most coding interviews. It‚Äôs a very curated and focused list for the most essential algorithms to leverage your time.

The playlist above is one of the clearest explanations I‚Äôve ever seen and highly recommend if you need an explanation on any of the problems.

### [CSES Problem Set](https://cses.fi/problemset/)
These problems are hard. Really hard for anyone who hasn‚Äôt practiced algorithms and is not beginner friendly. But if you are able to complete the sorting and searching section, you will be more capable than the average LeetCode user and be more than ready for your coding interview.

### [MeetAPro: an AirBnB style mock interview platform](https://www.meetapro.com/?utm_source=alexgh)
MeetAPro is the most cost-effective mock interview platform in the market. It connects job seekers with seasoned FAANG interviewers who provide invaluable feedback, getting you ready for real-life interviews.


Consider this if you‚Äôre comfortable with LeetCode medium questions and find the questions in CTCI too easy.
